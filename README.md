### amharic-afan-oromo-parallel-text-dataset
A parallel sentence translation dataset from Amharic to Afan Oromo languages

The corpus was first taken from ------ site by extracting all the English sentences from the English-to-french translation corpus. Then using Google's language translation service the English sentences were translated to Amharic Language.
Finally, the Amharic sentences were translated into the Afaan Oromo language, and the parallel corpus for Amharic and English was created.
